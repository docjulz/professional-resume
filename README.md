# Professional Resume

This is my professional resume.  It was created to not only showcase my professional experience, but also to demonstrate HTML and CSS skill.

This was created from scratch inspired by online tutorials.

I also have junior level experience using JavaScript and Python which will be showcased on separate repositories.

My background is in education, both formal and informal as well as museum education and digital engagement.
